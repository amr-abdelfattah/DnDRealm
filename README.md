**Alamofire** is an essential networking tool for any iOS developer to have under their belt. The framework is elegantly written entirely in Swift.

In this app, you’ll explore the following topics using Alamofire:

- Building a scalable pattern for organizing your networking stack.
- Handling different error responses.
- Dealing with authentication APIs.
- Setting a retry policy for request failures.
- Dealing with different request types.
- Tracking internet reachability status.



**DnDRealm**  app lets you search for Dungeons and Dragons equipment and monsters using [DnD API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#intro). Also, the app will feature fetching monster images using [Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/?version=latest#intro). And, you’ll implement images upload.
